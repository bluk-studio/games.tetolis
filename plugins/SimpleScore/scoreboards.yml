## Scoreboards (https://github.com/r4g3baby/SimpleScore/blob/main/src/main/resources/scoreboards.yml)
# This is where you create your scoreboards to be displayed.

# You can create a scoreboard by creating a node with the scoreboard name and
# then specifying a default "updateTime" and a list of "titles" and "scores".
#
# "updateTime": the default update time in ticks (optional and defaults to 20 ticks/1 second)
# "titles": text to display or a list of frames*
# "scores": the score number/value followed by the text to display or a list of frames* or a
#  map with the "conditions" (list of conditions) and "frames" (list of frames*) attributes
# *frames: is a list of strings or list of maps with the "text" (text to display) and
#  "time" (time to stay visible, optional and defaults to "updateTime") attributes
#
# Check out the examples bellow for more information.

# This is a simple scoreboard with only the top and bottom lines animated
simple:
  titles: 'Ô†Å   '
  scores:
    3: ''
    2: '        &b&l%sapi_default_scurrentmana%'
    1: ''

# Scoreboard with a basic timing example
customTiming:
  updateTime: 100 # Any title or frame without a specified time will default to this
  titles:
    - text: '&c200 ticks/10 seconds title'
      time: 200
    - text: '&a100 ticks/5 seconds title'
  scores:
    6: '&7You can set a per title and score time'
    5: '&7instead of using the default value'
    4: ''
    3:
      - text: '&7This will last for &810 seconds'
        time: 200
      - text: '&7while this only lasts for &85 seconds'
